                <p>At least 21 people, including one child, have died in overnight Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's southern Odesa region, Ukrainian officials say.

                    <p>The state emergency service, DSNS, says 16 people were killed in a nine-storey building hit by one missile in the village of Serhiyivka.
                    
                    Another five people, including the child, were killed in a separate strike on a holiday resort in the village.</p>
                    
                   <p>Russia has fired dozens of missiles on Ukrainian cities in the past few days.
                    
                    On Friday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov again denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets.</p> 
                    
                    "We heard three explosions and now there is nothing left of the recreation centre," local resident Yulia Bondar, 60, told the BBC.
                    
                    "The village is very quiet, we never thought this could happen."</p>

                <h2>Norway calls off gas strikes that risked UK supply
                </h2>
                <h5>My Newspaper, July 5, 2022</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" ><img src =https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15DEB/production/_125797598_easington.jpg></div>
                <p>Strikes which threatened to cut off most of the UK's gas imports from Norway have been called off.

                  <p> The Norwegian labour ministry confirmed it had stepped in to end industrial action set for later this week.
                    
                    "Workers are going back to work as soon as possible. We are cancelling the planned escalation," Lederne union leader Audun Ingvartsen told Reuters.
                    
                    The Department for Business had insisted: "The UK has no issues with gas supply."</p> 
                    
                 <p>  The UK imports about 50% of its gas and Norway is its biggest supplier making up 77% of imports, ONS data shows.
                    
                    Oil and gas from Norway, Europe's second-largest energy supplier after Russia, is in high demand as many countries reduce their dependence on Russian supplies in response to the war in Ukraine.
                    
                    Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?
                    The industrial action started on Monday following a pay dispute between the employer's organisation, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, and the union Lederne, which represents oil and gas workers.
                    
                    The first phase forced the Norwegian energy company Equinor to shut down three of its oil and gas fields. More strikes were expected on Tuesday evening, impacting three more Equinor facilities.
                    
                    The union had threatened to take further strike action from Saturday if the dispute was not resolved.</p>
                    
                    But labour minister, Marte Mjoes Persen, told Reuters the government had exercised its right to intervene.
                    
                    "Norway plays a vital role in supplying gas to Europe, and the planned escalation [of the strike] would have had serious consequences, for Britain, Germany and other nations," he said.
                    
                    "The volume impact would have been dramatic in light of the current European situation."<br>
                    
                    Reacting to the strike being called off, NOG, the oil lobby, said in a statement: "We are glad to see that the government understood the seriousness of the situation and acted to uphold Norway's reputation as a reliable and stable supplier of natural gas to Europe."
                    
                   <p> Norwegian gas arrives in the UK at two terminals - Easington in Yorkshire and St Fergus in Scotland.
                    
                    It was Saturday's planned strike that would have affected UK supplies as it would have temporarily closed the Sleipner field - a key distribution point for gas exports to the UK.
                    
                    Norwegian-state owned Gassco had told the BBC "in a worst case scenario, from this Saturday there will be zero deliveries to Easington", a gas terminal on the East Yorkshire coast, something reported by the Financial Times.
                    
                    But while the potential strike action would only have impacted the operations at Easington, Gassco said that was by far the most significant of the two, receiving 80% to 90% of the gas from Norway.<br>
                    
                    The Department for Business said: "We have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world, with access to our own North Sea gas reserves, and the second largest LNG port infrastructure in Europe."</p>
                    
                    Gassco transports gas to other European countries including Germany and Belgium. It's thought strike action would have prevented up to 170 million cubic litres of gas from being delivered, around 50% of the total daily delivery amount from the company.</p>

                    America's top court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last month, paving the way for states to enact their own bans
                    A judge in Mississippi has rejected a request from the state's only abortion clinic to temporarily block a ban on almost all abortions.
                    
                    It means that - providing there are no further legal developments - the ban will take effect on Thursday with the clinic closing the day before.<br>
                    
                    The ban can come into force because the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v Wade ruling last month.
                    
                    The 1973 decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion.<br>
                    
                    The decision to overturn it was met with scenes of protest and joy around the country, as both pro-choice and anti-abortion supporters reacted to a development that will transform abortion rights in America for years to come.
                    
                    Millions of women will lose access to abortion as conservative states such as Mississippi seek to pass their own laws to ban the procedure.</p>

                <h2>Sydney floods aftermath: 'Everybody is traumatised'</h2>

                <div class="fakeimg"><img src = https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8FAA/production/_125787763_mediaitem125787762.jpg></div>
                <p>In the town of Windsor, north-west of Sydney, some roads have turned into small rivers. And the only way to get around is by boat.

                    Mathew Benson has been rowing up and down one of the streets in a neighbourhood in the suburb of Australia's largest city.
                    
                    "I'm bringing food and water to people over there," he tells me, pointing to the other side. "We're just watching and waiting."<br>
                    
                    While some cars are barely visible, others are completely submerged. Many residents in the area have had to leave their homes and others are stranded as roads have been cut off. Thousands have been left without power.Another local, Sam, points to her house just across the submerged road. "We don't know about the second floor. But the first floor is definitely flooded," she tells me in tears.

                    This is the second time this has happened to her this year. Her house was damaged in the floods back in March. This time, she has had to move in with her mother who now also has to evacuate.</p>
